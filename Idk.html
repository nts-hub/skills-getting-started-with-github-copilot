  root((Critique of Eurocentric Historical Sociology & Alternatives))
    (I. Foundational Exclusions (pp.1-3))
      - Hegel (Phil. of World History)
        -- Non-Europeans "less human", lacked historical consciousness/contribution
        -- Africa "unhistorical continent", ignorable
      - Durkheim (Ethnology vs Sociology)
        -- Sociology for "civilized" West (past focus)
        -- Ethnology for "primitive" Rest (present focus)
      - Result: Geographical/Temporal Hierarchy established
    (II. Critique of Contemporary Hist. Soc. (pp.1-3))
      - Perpetuation of Legacy
        -- Marginalization of ex-colonies (esp. Africa) in studies (states, revs, demo.)
        -- Assumption: Unidirectional diffusion (West -> Rest)
        -- Assumption: Europe untouched by colonial encounter
      - Critique of Assumption
        -- Erroneous & Theoretically Limiting
        -- Failure of "Sociological Imagination" (C.W. Mills)
      - Call for Reimagining
        -- Colonization *within* metropole (S. Hall)
        -- "Remember empire differently" (C. Hall) -> Affects questions/work
    (III. Classical Legacy & Methods (pp.1-3))
      - Enduring Influence (Skocpol: Classical Qs persist)
      - Methods Not Neutral (Shaped by assumptions)
      - Source of Eurocentrism (Theory construction despite comparison)
      - Weber's Method
        -- Comparison (Occident vs Orient) -> Highlight Western uniqueness
        -- Western "rationality" via non-Western "absence" (India example - Thapar)
      - Durkheim's Method
        -- Comparison ("Primitive" vs "Modern") -> Unilinear evolution
        -- "Primitive" = simplified early West
        -- Comparative method essential for sociology as science
    (IV. Ignoring Colonialism's Role (pp.1-3))
      - Key Assumption: Societies as independent "closed systems" (Internal dynamics primary)
      - Necessity of Avoidance: Needed to maintain "closed system" fiction -> Allowed Eurocentric theories despite colonial data
      - Weber's Avoidance
        -- Acknowledged "colonial booty capitalism" profit but didn't integrate
        -- Attributed capitalism solely to Western "rationalism"
        -- Ignored mutual implication (West/East), colonial disruption (e.g., India deindustrialization - Brockway)
        -- Used colonial sources (Indologists - Said) but ignored context
      - Durkheim's Avoidance
        -- Theories (Solidarity) assumed "primitive" untouched by imperialism
        -- Relied on colonial data (officials, missionaries - Fenton) while denying influence (*Elementary Forms* examples)
        -- Drew contemporary criticism (Van Gennep on sources - Lukes)
        -- Enabled functionalism (internal evolution) over systemic colonial view (Fenton)
    (V. Constructing a "Counter-Canon" (pp.3-6))
      - Early Voices (G.W. Williams, Equiano, Du Bois, Cooper, Blyden, James, Fanon, Césaire)
        -- Williams: Integrated Africa, challenged Euro-origins (Egypt link)
        -- Shared Goal: Asserted centrality of African peoples (Kelley)
      - Du Bois's Praxis
        -- Context: Responding to racist sociology (Charles)
        -- Critique: Exclusion of Africa = unsound, rationalization for slavery; Standard Qs = racist framework
        -- Method: Used formal Western methods (Harvard/Berlin) to *subvert* substance (Robinson)
      - Core Challenges to Classics
        -- vs Cultural Determinism -> Emphasized Global Capitalism/Exploitation
        -- vs Comparative Primacy -> Focused on Interconnection
        -- vs Conceptual Objectivity -> Deconstructed terms
      - Focus: Political Economy
        -- Analysis of Slavery -> Linked development to exploitation
        -- Du Bois (*Suppression*, *Black Reconstruction* - Marx influence), E. Williams, Frank, Rodney, Wallerstein (World-Systems: West/Rest linked)
      - Methodological Innovation
        -- Beyond National Comparison (Wallerstein critique - Ragin & Chirot)
        -- Interconnectedness/Dialogue (West Indian thinkers)
        -- C.L.R. James (*Black Jacobins*): Reciprocal influence (Haiti -> France), centered non-Western agency
        -- Post-Colonial Studies (Mutual constitution - C. Hall; Transnational links - Ware, McClintock, Stoler, Comaroffs, Thorne, Winant, Goldberg, S. Hall)
      - Transnational Units
        -- Building on diaspora thinkers (Brown, Lewis, Crummell)
        -- Focus on diaspora/transnational communities (Gilroy, Hesse)
        -- Method: Parallels, "Transculturation"/"Cultural Translation" (S. Hall)
        -- Examples: Barkey (Ottoman), Centeno/Wickham-Crowley (LatAm)
    (VI. Critiquing Core Concepts (pp.6-9))
      - Problem: Continued use of "neutral" concepts ("Western Civ.", "Democracy", "Rationalization")
      - Source: Anti-colonial thought
      - Said (1979): "Idea of Europe" as constructed superiority, silencing others
      - Negritude (Césaire)
        -- Movement: French-speaking Black intellectuals rejecting West domination
        -- Attacked objectivity ("Rationality", "Civilization" - biased West/Rest view)
        -- Saw concepts ("man", "nation") as class myths (Robinson)
        -- Inverted barbarism/civilization binary -> Accused Europe of barbarism/destruction
      - Subaltern Studies (Spivak, Guha, Chakrabarty, Chatterjee - founded 1982)
        -- Goal: History from below, challenge elite/colonial/nationalist narratives (Young)
        -- Method: Recover subaltern agency/insurgency (Spivak), "people on their own" (Guha)
        -- Critique: "Provincializing Europe" (Chakrabarty), Hegelian Eurocentrism/statism (Guha)
    (VII. Methodological Focus & Future Directions (pp.6-9))
      - Alternative Methods: Discourse analysis, Hybridity (Bhabha), Foucauldian, Deconstruction
      - Interpretive Historical Sociology
        -- Orientation: Closer to E.P. Thompson vs B. Moore
        -- Goal: Meaningful interpretations (Actor intentions + Present relevance) vs Universal Laws
        -- Examples: Goldman (World Bank), Pieterse (Development), Steinmetz, Lo, Go, Ignacio, Sohrabi
      - Shift: "Closed" -> "Open" Systems (Interdependence, Interpenetration, Exchange)
        -- Undermines traditional comparison -> Need for alternative methods
      - Generalization Debate: Interpretive turn often avoids, but not always (Brechin vs Gille)
      - Transnationalizing Inquiry
        -- Beyond Nation-State unit (Ignacio, Poster, Go)
        -- Re-examining Core Topics (democracy, class, state) in global/colonial context
        -- Stoler (1995): Western ideas forged/refined in colonies (liberalism, bureaucracy, discipline)
        -- Examples: Morant Bay/UK Reform (C. Hall); Boer War/Suffrage (Burton); Algeria/France (Prochaska); Caribbean/Industry (Mintz)
        -- Re-reading Skocpol (French Rev) considering colonial impact (James, Malik)
      - Conclusion
        -- Productive Tensions from de-Eurocentrizing
        -- Embrace "overlapping territories and intertwined histories" (Said 1994)
        -- Field Transformation: Integrating Global South perspectives
